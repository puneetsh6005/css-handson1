    <h2>What is Css</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Sytle Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS descrides how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media</li>
        <li>
            <span class="a"><b> CSS is not neccesary</b></span><span class="b"> <b>CSS saves a lot of work.</b></span><span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="c">Css is not neccesary are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>CSS can be Added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elemental</li>
        <li>Internal - by using the style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using  a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS . is keep the style in external CSS files. however.<span class="d"><b>in the tuturial we will use inline and internal styles.</b></span>because this is casier to demonstrate. and casier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> When comparing CSS class vs ID the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements,ID on the other hand applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript</p>  
            <p>In CSS selectors are used to target a specific element or range of element on a web page.Once an element has been targeted a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
            <P>There is a wide range of selection available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used target elements to which a style should be applied.</P>
